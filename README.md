# google-contact-csv

A short script I wrote in a time of desperate need. The script takes a txt file that contains names and contact numbers separated by a space, and converts them into a csv file in accordance with the Google contact csv template. You can then simply improt the generated file to google contacts to transfer all your contacts.

## Files
  
  1. `init.py` - Contains the script
  2. `contacts.csv` - Google contact csv template
  3. `contacts.txt` - Txt file template to convert to csv
